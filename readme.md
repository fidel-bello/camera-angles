  ## Description
    * This mod is a dll injector written in c++
    * for educational purposes
    * the cheat engine table basically has the memory address for the functions and pointers
    * The game does not have a feature for the user to make their own camera angles while playing the game. How can this be implemented?
    With the help of windows api, I have been able to implement this via terminal commands. The user can pick a variety of different camera angles from hard coded values in the program.
